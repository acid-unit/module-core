# About

This is a helper module for [ðŸ§ªAcid Unit](https://acid.7prism.com/) 
<span title="Magento">Adobe Commerce</span> extensions.

Currently, it provides a _**{placeholder / content}**_ mechanism of updating page content

There is no need to install it explicitly, it will be pulled up automatically
as a dependency to other packages.

But in case you still have to have it for some reason in your root `composer.json` file, 
you can install it with `composer require acid-unit/module-core` command.

# Requirements

As long as you have at least `Adobe Commerce 2.4.4` with running `PHP 8.1` or newer, 
everything should be fine.
